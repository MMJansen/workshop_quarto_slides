# Creating Slides with Quarto

These are the files used for a workshop on creating slides with Quarto. The workshop is mainly about Revealjs.

Take a look at:  

-  `workshop_quarto_slides.pdf` for the handout
-  `workshop_quarto_slides.html` to see the slides as presented during the workshop
-  `workshop_quarto_slides.qmd` to see how the slides were made


To get the workshop experience:  

-  Start by reading either
    -  `workshop_quarto_slides.pdf`
    -  `workshop_quarto_slides.html`
    -  the html is a lot nicer
-  Do the exercises when prompted
